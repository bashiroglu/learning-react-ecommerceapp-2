This is learning based project which I practise some React features. The idea of this project was taken from Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang's  Udemy course called [ Complete React Developer in 2020 (Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) and followed along with videos and hopefully added some extra feature.

The name of project: learning-react-ecommerceapp-2

Used Language concepts:

1. 
2. 
3. 


After download project files, in the project directory, you can run :

### `npm start`
