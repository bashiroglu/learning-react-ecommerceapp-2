This is learning based project which I practise some React features. The idea of this project was taken from Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang's  Udemy course called [ Complete React Developer in 2020 (Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) and followed along with videos and hopefully added some extra features.

The name of project: learning-react-ecommerceapp-2

Used Language concepts:

1. node-sass (to style components)
2. react-router-dom (to manage routes)
3. firebase (to store data(from users to products))
4. redux react-redux(to manage state in react) redux-logger(middleware to log state) 


After download project files, in the project directory, you can run :

### `npm start`
